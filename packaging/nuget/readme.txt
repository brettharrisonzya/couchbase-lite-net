Welcome to Couchbase Lite .NET.  If you are upgrading from a previous version then please ensure that you remove the SQLitePCL.raw and SQLitePCL.ugly packages from your project before continuing.  

Also familiarize yourself with the new storage engine mechanism by viewing https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-net/blob/release/1.2/Notes/StorageEngineOverview.md

Thank you!
